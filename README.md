There is a big history behind our bounties program. **TON Footsteps** title for the honorable SBT is inherited from the historical name of our bounties program - TON Footsteps. We were used to  call those community contributions "Footsteps" as they are actually small steps on a big journey of our great TON Ecosystem. Don't miss your chance to become part of this history!
